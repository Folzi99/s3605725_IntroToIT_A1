  <h2>What features of this work are important to you?  What features would you consider as requirements for the job to be considered “ideal”? </h2>
  <p id="para_sets"> I have done some broad research into what an ideal career in IT would involve. Personally, I don't really like the idea of working five days a week. I feel confident enough in my ability to manage my finances well enough to work just four days a week.  The sad reality is that most jobs don't have thise kind a flexability. Which I disagree with but thats a whole other can of worms. Since I don't live in an ideal world, here's a list of some things would be must keen on finding for a future career in IT: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b style="color: #00ff36;">Working hours: </b>Mon - Fri</li>
    <li><b style="color: #00ff36;">Pay: </b>$70~$80k (I'd like to earn more once I progress to a more senior roles)</li>
    <li><b style="color: #00ff36;">Location:  </b>Melbourne CBD, with option to work from home</li>
    <li><b style="color: #00ff36;">Flexibility: </b>flexible work hours and working location</li>
    <li><b style="color: #00ff36;">Variety of work: </b>diverse and creatively stimulating; nothing monotonous</li>
    <li><b style="color: #00ff36;">Skills required: </b>high level of skills in IT and programming, something that requires mental stimulations, not just labour entenstive skills</li>
    <li><b style="color: #00ff36;">Amount of creativity: </b>high level of creativity</li>
    <li><b style="color: #00ff36;">Prospects for travel: </b>high prospects for travel/to work abroad</li>
    <li><b style="color: #00ff36;">Level of teamwork: </b>team work is okay but I prefer working alone.</li>
    <li><b style="color: #00ff36;">Amount of interaction with customers, clients, investors, management, and/or the general public: </b>limited interactions with customers/general public, I hate peop--hospitality.</li>
    <li><b style="color: #00ff36;">Opportunities for personal development and growth: </b>Keen to find a position where I can be promoted/progress to more senior role.</li>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p id="para_sets">The position requires the candidate to be able to conceive and implement features on websites for front end use to enable users to interact with the backend structures. It also is expected that a level of creativity is required to formulate and execute ideas that can be used in the systems.</p>
  <h2>Skills</h2>
  <p id="para_sets">The role requires proficient knowledge in various program languages such as;  React, NodeJS, JavaScript, HTML, Python and CSS.
    <br>Experience with systems like:  AWS Lambda, SNS/SQS, S3, IAM, CloudWatch, RDS and DynamoDB, AWS CLI, Sagemaker. Qualifications include computer science/IT background.
    <br>A lot of the ‘fundamental’ skills like effective communication, organization, and the ability to work well in teams are transferable skills I have from other jobs I’ve worked that are necessary for any professional role. I also have a passion for art and good design so believe a front end development role would be something that I can utilise those skills in to create a more user friendly interface. </p>
  <h2>The Plan</h2>
  <p id="para_sets">Skills I want/need to learn for this role require refined skills in using programming languages. My goal is to grasp HTML, CSS and Python first, then progress to other languages like Java.I need to gain experience in learning systems like Github for project management and other cloud-based systems like the Amazon systems listed in the advertisement. I will also need a degree in a computer science/IT field as a bare minimum.I imagine I will likely learn many of the fundamental skills listed about from university. However, I can gain additional certifications during my course to add to my resume to help me stand out. </p>
